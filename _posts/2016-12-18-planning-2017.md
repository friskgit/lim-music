We are currently planning our activities for 2017. We will try out new material in concerts and will aim for a new recording for release in early 2018. Artistically we are thinking about going back to some of the tunes we did on the CD with [Marc Ducret](/cds/ducret.html) released in 2011. In particular the song "How Yellow Can This Be?" uses elements and structures that can be further developed. Exactly how is something we can come back to.

Soon we will post the music from various CDs here under its own heading!

lim wishes you all Merry Christmas!
